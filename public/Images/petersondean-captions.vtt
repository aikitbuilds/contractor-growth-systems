Steve Huber discussing the Peterson Dean sales growth strategy

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The key to our success was building scalable systems from day one

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We focused on creating repeatable, trainable processes

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This allowed us to quickly expand across multiple states

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The results were transformational - from zero to over $300M in revenue
