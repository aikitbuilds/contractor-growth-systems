00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Welcome to our breakdown of the federal solar investment tax credit,
one of the most powerful financial incentives for solar adoption.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:12.000
Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act passed in 2022, the solar ITC has been
extended and enhanced, providing homeowners with significant savings.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.000
Currently, the credit offers 30% off the total cost of solar installation
for systems installed between 2022 and 2032.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.000
This credit applies not only to the panels themselves but also to labor costs,
system components, and even battery storage.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.000
For contractors, understanding this tax credit is essential for helping
customers make informed decisions and overcome price objections.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.000
Remember to emphasize that this is a dollar-for-dollar reduction in taxes owed,
not just a deduction, making it extremely valuable.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.000
By properly explaining these benefits to your customers, you can improve your closing rate
and establish yourself as a knowledgeable resource in the industry.
